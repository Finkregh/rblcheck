This program is a very basic interface to DNS filters such as the RBL
filter developed by Paul Vixie and the MAPS project. The basic idea of the
filter is that when someone is blacklisted for email abuse of some sort, a
new domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
domain name of the filtering service (such as "rbl.maps.vix.com", for the
MAPS project RBL filter).

For information on compiling this program, see the file docs/INSTALL.

This program has only been tested by the author under Linux 2.x, Solaris
2.5.1, and Solaris 2.6, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on another
platform, as long as a working resolver library exists (the one from BIND
will do perfectly).

For more information about RBL-style blacklists, please take a look at
http://maps.vix.com/rbl/ and http://www.dorkslayers.com/ . For more
information about BIND, drop by http://www.isc.org/bind.html . The
official home for rblcheck is http://www.xnet.com/~emarshal/rblcheck/ .

Any ideas, bugfixes, or porting notes should be sent to me at
"emarshal@logic.net". Don't bug the MAPS or Dorkslayers people about this;
they didn't write it, and probably woudn't like getting a bunch of mail
about it.
