-- GENERAL THANKS:

Paul Vixie <paul@vix.com>: For the original RBL, a fantastic tool for
	the prevention of spam.

The MAPS project <URL:http://maps.vix.com/>: A great gathering point for
	protection services regarding email. Everyone there should be
	given a pat on the back for the thankless hours they put into
	maintaining an excellent resource for everyone.

Dorkslayers.com <URL:http://www.dorkslayers.com/>: Another good RBL-alike
	system, which focuses singularly on open email relays.

Stephen R. van den Berg <srb@cuci.nl>: For writing Procmail, a nifty
	little mail filtering tool. While certainly not the only place
	to use rblcheck, it's certainly one of the most useful.

-- IDEA PEOPLE:

Russell Nelson <nelson@crynwr.com>: suggested that reading IP address of
	sender in the Received: lines in QMail might almost be a sane
	thing to do. I still disagree, but hey, it works.

Frank Tegtmeyer <fte@iqweb.de>: suggested the idea for the '-t' option
	for displaying the TXT record.

Anders Eriksson <aer@cdt.luth.se>: Pointed out that I failed to provide
	a simple set of tests for people to try out.

Kevin Kadow <kadokev@ripco.com>: suggested a novel use for rblcheck as
	a means of rejecting email via inetd.

Ronald F. Guilmette <rfg@monkeys.com>: noted how silly it was to send
	useful output to stderr, and suggested a "make install" target.

-- CODE PEOPLE:

Ophir Ronen <ophir@internap.com>: supplied the origip.pl script which
	pulls the remote IP address from Sendmail Received: headers.

Brian Willoughby <brianw@sounds.wa.com>: supplied patches for NeXT.

Jeff A. Earickson <jaearick@colby.edu>: supplied patches for HP-UX.

Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>: supplied patches for version
	output.

Pat Myrto <pat@rwing.COM>: supplied patches for SunOS.

William Yang <wyang@freenet.columbus.oh.us>: supplied early patches for
	supporting multiple RBL-alike services.

-- BUG PEOPLE:

Timothy J Luoma <luomat@peak.org>
Adam Shand <larry@alaska.net>
Andrew Kelley <kelleya@dimensional.com>
Thomas Meyer <tmeyer@ifi.unizh.ch>
Jonathan Bradshaw <jonathan@NrgUp.Com>
