-- GENERAL THANKS:

Paul Vixie <paul@vix.com>: For the RBL itself, a fantastic tool for the
	prevention of spam.

The MAPS project <URL:http://maps.vix.com/>: A great gathering point for
	protection services regarding email. Everyone there should be
	given a pat on the back for the thankless hours they put into
	maintaining an excellent resource for everyone.

Stephen R. van den Berg <srb@cuci.nl>: For writing Procmail, a nifty
	little mail filtering tool. While certainly not the only place
	to use rblcheck, it's certainly one of the most useful.

-- IDEA PEOPLE:

Russell Nelson <nelson@crynwr.com>: suggested that reading IP address of
	sender in the Received: lines in QMail might almost be a sane
	thing to do. I still disagree, but hey, it works.

Frank Tegtmeyer <fte@iqweb.de>: suggested the idea for the '-t' option
	for displaying the TXT record.

Anders Eriksson <aer@cdt.luth.se>: Pointed out that I failed to provide
	a simple set of tests for people to try out.

Kevin Kadow <kadokev@ripco.com>: suggested a novel use for rblcheck as
	a means of rejecting email via inetd.

-- CODE PEOPLE:

Ophir Ronen <ophir@internap.com>: supplied the origip.pl script which
	pulls the remote IP address from Sendmail Received: headers.

Brian Willoughby <brianw@sounds.wa.com>: Supplied patches for NeXT.

Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>: Supplied patches for version
	output.

-- BUG PEOPLE:

Pat Myrto <pat@rwing.COM>
Adam Shand <larry@alaska.net>
