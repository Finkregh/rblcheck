Changes since 1.1:

- a bunch of portability fixes, plus some minor code cleanup to make
  things a little more comfortable on multiple platforms. Should now
  compile on K&R-only systems, and on machines with wierd resolver
  libraries.

Changes since 1.0:

- clarified the procmail recipe in INSTALL to include some logic to
  prevent problems with local email if the system rblcheck is running
  on has actually been blacklisted.

- Noticed a glaring error in QMail support: TCPREMOTEIP is NOT passed
  on to .qmail-executed programs. Damn.

- added origip.c and origip.awk to obtain the sender's IP address from
  QMail headers.

- added "docs" and "utils" directories to organize things a bit better.

- added "extern int optind;" to make some platforms a little happier.

- fixed compilation on NeXT.

- added some useful usage output, and added a '-v' flag for version info.

- added a '-t' flag for displaying of TXT RRs.
