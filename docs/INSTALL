This is a placeholder for an older file which is still referenced from
the README files all over the place.

A transition to SGML-based documentation is under way. Refer to the
file rlbcheck.sgml in this directory.

The installation instructions for this test release differ from what
is in the SGML file, though. What follows is a brief stopgap-type
installation manual, which assumes you are vaguely familiar with
Autoconf and related systems (experience with installing standard GNU
tools should suffice).

 0. Disregard any mention of docs/INSTALL and ./configure in the
    "real" instructions for the time being.

 1. In the root directory, run autoconf.

    If you don't have autoconf on your system, see if you can fake it
    with config/missing

 2. If you like, edit sites.h.

    In particular, you may wish to uncomment ORBS and/or other popular
    services which are commented out by default.

 3. Now, you can proceed to follow the instructions in ./INSTALL

    To wit, run ./configure with the options you like, then make, then
    make install.

If you run into any trouble, please file a bug report. This software
is provided in this state in the hope that it will be useful, but we
think it would be more useful still if any problems are reported back
to the authors. Thanks for contributing!
