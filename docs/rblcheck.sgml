<Title>About rblcheck</Title>

<Para>
This program is a very basic interface to DNS listings such as the RBL
filter operated by the MAPS project. The basic idea of the filter is that
when someone is listed (for example, a blacklist for email abusers), a new
domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
domain name of the filtering service (such as "blackholes.mail-abuse.org",
for the MAPS project RBL filter).
</Para>
</Chapter>

<Chapter id="building">
<Title>Building</Title>

<Para>
Before building rblcheck, edit the file <Filename>sites.h</Filename> for
the listings you wish to check against (to un-comment a listing, remove
the <ComputerOutput>/*</ComputerOutput> and <ComputerOutput>*/</ComputerOutput>
around the <ComputerOutput>SITE(...)</ComputerOutput> line).
</Para>

<Para>
To compile rblcheck, just run <Application>./configure</Application> in
the main directory, followed by <Application>make</Application> when the
first command is complete. For more details on how the
<Application>configure</Application> command works, please see the file
<Filename>INSTALL</Filename> in the main directory.
</Para>

<Para>
Note to developers: if you see a script called
<Application>bootstrap</Application> in the main directory, then you are
using a development release, and you will need a few extra tools to compile
rblcheck. Specifically, you will need to make sure that autoconf and
automake are installed correctly on your system before you can build. Once
you have satisfied those requirements, please run
<Application>./bootstrap</Application> from the main directory before
running the <Application>./configure</Application> script mentioned above.
</Para>

<Para>
Note to distributors: I highly recommend leaving everything commented out
in sites.h; this was really only added as a convenience mechanism for
personal builds, not for a distributor to <Emphasis>help</Emphasis> the
user set policy. Your users may be smarter than you think; let them make
up their own mind.
</Para>
</Chapter>

<Chapter id="using">
<Title>Using</Title>

<Para>
When invoked, rblcheck returns either 0 (to indicated error, or that the
address was not in any of the listings), or a positive number (indicating
the number of listings that the IP address was found in).
</Para>

<Para>
The program has several command line options:
</Para>

</TBody>
</TGroup>
</InformalTable>

<Para>
To verify that the program is working after you've compiled it, try the
following test:
</Para>

<Screen>$ ./rblcheck -s blackholes.mail-abuse.org 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1 not RBL filtered by blackholes.mail-abuse.org
$ ./rblcheck -s blackholes.mail-abuse.org 127.0.0.2
127.0.0.2 RBL filtered by blackholes.mail-abuse.org</Screen>

<Para>
If you see any other result than the above, then something has gone wrong;
please see below about reporting bugs and finding help.
</Para>

<Para>
You can check multiple addresses at once, to make life a little easier
with scripts; just add additional addresses on the command line after all
of the options. By specifying an address of "-", rblcheck will read from
stdin and perform a lookup on every line of input (if it is a valid IP
address).
</Para>
</Chapter>

<Chapter id="thirdparty">
<Title>Third-Party Software</Title>

<Para>
rblcheck works well as a command-line tool for performing lookups, but it
also serves an important role working with other software, such as mail
servers and email filtering programs.
</Para>

<Section>
<Title>Procmail</Title>

<Para>
rblcheck was really designed to be used with procmail, as long as you have
access to the IP address of the system sending you email. Surprisingly,
most MTAs make obtaining this information more difficult than it needs to
be. The procmail rule I present here assumes you've found some way to put
the IP address of the sender in the variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
See the sections below on Sendmail and QMail for ideas on how you can get
ahold of this value.
</Para>

<Para>
The following procmail rule will, once you have <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>,
use rblcheck to look up the IP address in the built-in filters:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>:0
* ! ? if [ -n "$TCPREMOTEIP" ]; then rblcheck -q "$TCPREMOTEIP"; fi
{
	EXITCODE=100
	LOGABSTRACT=all
	LOG="Filter: RBL-filtered address: \"$TCPREMOTEIP\"
"
	:0:
	$FILTER_FOLDER
}</ProgramListing>

<Para>
<EnVar>FILTERFOLDER</EnVar> is assumed to have been set up ahead of
time as the place to put email that you don't want to see (either another
incoming folder, /dev/null, or a 'formail' invokation that rewrites the
message and tacks on an extra header or munges the subject so you can
easily identify it.
</Para>

<Para>
Note that <EnVar>EXITCODE</EnVar> above is for QMail, and indicates a
permanent error. Under Sendmail, 77 is more appropriate. Under anything
else, it's hard to say; your best bet is to refer to the documentation
regarding execution of programs.
</para>

<Para>
One more thing: procmail has a nasty habit of munging the environment, but
most MTAs already do this for you. Hence, you should add the '-p' flag to
the invokation of procmail (either from a local delivery rule in Sendmail,
or from a .forward or .qmail file). This will ensure that procmail doesn't
clean out the value of <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
</Para>

<Para>
To test the procmail recipe:
</Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Save any mail message, with full headers, to a file.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to an offending address, and with the message you just saved as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.2 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message went through,
you have a problem. If you have a message in your logfile stating
that the message was bounced for being in the RBL, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to a non-filtered address, such as 127.0.0.1, and with the message as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.1 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message didn't go
through, you have a problem. If you have a copy of the message in
your mailbox, and no errors in your log file, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</OrderedList>
</Section>

<Section>
<Title>Sendmail</Title>

<Para>
This solution for obtaining the IP address of the connecting host could be
considered to be a bit of a hack, but it works quite reliably. If you're
an ordinary user on your system, you won't be able to use this; talk to
your system administrator about the possibility of installing the
sendmail.cf patch below. Point them at this file as a source of
information.
</Para>

<Para>
Currently, in your sendmail.cf file, you'll probably have something like:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
Or, if you're using procmail as the local delivery agent:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@ShPfn, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=procmail -a $h -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This is the local delivery rule used to execute .forward scripts.  Your
system might use something like <Application>rsh</Application> or another
restricted shell instead of <Application>sh</Application> for running
programs. Don't let that scare you; they all basically work the same.
</Para>

<Para>
Change the above lines to look like this (there will also be Mprog lines
which look similar; you can modify them in exactly the same manner):
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/env, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=env TCPREMOTEIP="${client_addr}" mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
(replacing "mail -f $g -d $u" with "procmail -a $h -d $u" appropriately.)
</Para>

<Para>
ONLY change the P=... and A=... entries. Most certainly do not mess with
F=... unless you know what you are doing.
</Para>

<Para>
This will create an environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>, which
you can now use with rblcheck to determine if the address has been blocked.
To test this, set up an alias like:
</Para>

<Screen>foo: |mailx -s "$TCPREMOTEIP" user@domain.com</Screen>

<Para>
Then, send email to the alias "foo" (or whatever). You should
immediately get a piece of email with the IP address which sent the
message in the subject line. (Replace <Application>mailx</Application>
with <Application>mail</Application> on some systems.)
</Para>

<Para>
This is about the most efficient means of getting this information to
executed programs that I can see with sendmail. What would -really- be
nice here would be a way to program how Sendmail sets up the environment
before executing an external program, at the point of execution. Bug the
Sendmail developers if you agree with me. ;-)
</Para>
</Section>

<Section>
<Title>QMail</Title>

<Para>
Getting this going under QMail turns out to be a real challenge, since
QMail doesn't have the same level of programmability that Sendmail has.
Hence, we need to employ an additional script to grab the IP address from
the headers. (Thanks to Russell Nelson for confirming QMail's behavior
here.)
</Para>

<Para>
QMail has a very specific means of adding Received: lines to messages,
making them relatively easy to parse. For example, the following headers
are typical:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Return-Path: &lt;emarshal@xnet.com&gt;
Delivered-To: emarshal@LOGIC.NET
Received: (qmail 26029 invoked from network); 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
Received: from quake.xnet.com (HELO mail.xnet.com) (198.147.221.35)
  by labyrinth.logic.net with SMTP; 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
We can disregard the Return-Path: and Delivered-To: lines; they're
unimportant to us. The Received: headers are the most interesting. The
first Received: line we'll see is the local delivery of the mail; hence,
the "qmail 2609 invoked from network". The second Received: line is the
most important to us; it's the one which contains the IP address of the
sender...in this case, 198.147.221.35. To complicate things, the "(HELO
mail.xnet.com)" section may not exist, and the IP address might have ident
information prepended to it (like "qmailr@198.147.221.35").
</Para>

<Para>
Two programs are provided to help you retrieve this information
automatically from the headers, both with the same semantics. "origip.c"
compiles into "origip", and for those who have trouble compiling it (if
you do, please email me with any errors), "origip.awk" is provided which
behaves the same way.
</Para>

<Para>
Essentially, you pass either of these programs an email message, and they
in turn extract the sending address and either print it back to you, or
exit with a non-zero return value.
</Para>

<Para>
To use this in procmail, just use:
</Para>

<Screen>TCPREMOTEIP=`origip || echo 127.0.0.1`</Screen>

<Para>
This will pipe the message through origip (replace origip with
"origip.awk" in the case of using the awk script), and will capture the
address. If there is an error, we'll default to 127.0.0.1, which will
allow the mail through.
</Para>

<Para>
(If you're undecided which program of the two you want to use, consider
that the C version is much faster, and will be maintained more than the
awk script. However, the C version is probably more prone to bugs. ;-)
</Para>

<Para>
Once you have that line in place, go ahead and use the procmail recipe
supplied above in good health.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section>
<Title>inetd and smtpd</Title>

<Para>
If you use an smtp server which runs from inetd (sendmail can operate this
way, as can QMail and a number of other MTAs), here's a good way to do
site-wide filtering using rblcheck; add the following to /etc/hosts.allow:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
smtpd: ALL: spawn /usr/local/bin/rblcheck -q %a &amp;&amp; \
	exec /usr/local/bin/smtpd || /bin/echo \
	"469 Connection refused. See http://maps.vix.com/rbl/\r\b\r\n"
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This gives you RBL support on a site-wide basis, even if native support
doesn't yet exist for your MTA of choice. This assumes that your inetd has
support for tcp_wrappers checks; many Linux variants fall into this
category, but other platforms may differ.
</Para>

<Para>
A word of warning, however: there are a number of very good reasons to not
run a production mail server from inetd, which I won't elaborate on here.  
You might want to investigate more secure and reliable alternatives, such
as tcpserver from D. J. Bernstein's excellent
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</ULink> package.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section>
<Title>Other Software</Title>

<Para>
Don't ask me. If you figure out a way to make this work under another
setup, let me know how you did it, and I'll add it here. If you find
better ways of doing this than the ones I'm using above, let me know too,
and you'll see your idea show up in here in the next release.
</Para>

<Title>Notes on origip</Title>

<Para>
Not convinced that you should use the C version of origip? Here's some
data (using test_origip.sh as a testbed) which definitely speaks volumes:
</Para>

<Para>
With origip.awk:
</Para>

<Para>
10 seconds faster, 3 seconds less system time used, 5 seconds less user
time, and over 30,000 less page faults. In other words: a LOT easier on
the box you'll be running this on. This test was run on a little under 600
messages, from various mailing lists and private messages, on a Linux

    <Para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</Para>

    <Para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this

    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</Para>

    <Para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</Para>

    <Para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.

  <Section label="3">
    <Title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</Title>

    <Para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</Para>

    <Para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</Para>

    <Para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</Para>

    <Para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</Para>

    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</Para>

    <OrderedList numeration="upperalpha">
      <ListItem><Para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</Para>
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem><Para>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</Para>
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
    
    <Para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</Para>

    <Para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</Para>

    <Para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</Para>

    <Para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="5">
    <Title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</Title>

    <Para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</Para>

    <Para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</Para>

    <Para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="6">
    <Title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</Title>

    <Para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</Para>

    <Para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="7">
    <Title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</Title>
    
    <Para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</Para>

    <Para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="8">
    <Title>TRANSLATION</Title>

    <Para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="9">
    <Title>TERMINATION</Title>
    
    <Para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="10">
    <Title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</Title>

    <Para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ULink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ULink>.</Para>

    <Para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</Para>
  </Section>

  <Section label="">
    <Title>How to use this License for your documents</Title>

    <Para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</Para>

<BlockQuote><Para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1

</Para></BlockQuote>

    <Para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</Para>

    <Para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</Para>
